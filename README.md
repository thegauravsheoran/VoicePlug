VoicePlug Frontend Assignment - Reporting Dashboard

cd reporting-dashboard

npm install

Run the development server:

Design Decisions:-

Component-based structure: The app is divided into Dashboard and NotificationForm components for clarity and reusability.
Mock data is simulated with a timeout to mimic an API call. This keeps the app frontend-only and easy to run locally.
Tailwind CSS was used for quick, consistent, and responsive styling.
Form validation ensures users provide a valid email before proceeding.
The chart and form layout is fully responsive to support various screen sizes and mobile devices.
