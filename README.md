## Design Decisions

- **Component-based structure:**  
    The app is divided into `Dashboard` and `NotificationForm` components for clarity and reusability.

- **Mock data simulation:**  
    Mock data is simulated with a timeout to mimic an API call, keeping the app frontend-only and easy to run locally.

- **Styling with Tailwind CSS:**  
    Tailwind CSS was used for quick, consistent, and responsive styling.

- **Form validation:**  
    Ensures users provide a valid email before proceeding.

- **Responsive design:**  
    The chart and form layout is fully responsive to support various screen sizes and mobile devices.
